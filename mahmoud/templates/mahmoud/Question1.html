<div class="well well-lg">
    <div>
        You have CHF {{Constants.q1endowment}} to be allocated to 2 identical dice, D1 and D2, both of which have 3
        sides coloured in blue and
        3
        sides coloured in red. Both dice will be rolled simultaneously. If D1 lands on red, you win the amount that you
        allocated to D1, otherwise you loose that amount. Similarly, if D2 lands on red, you win the amount that you
        allocated to D2, otherwise you loose that amount.
    </div>

        Note that in the majority of the following cases, there is a cost associated with splitting your CHF
        {{Constants.q1endowment}}
        endowment
        amongst the two dice, but there is no cost associated with allocating your entire endowment to one of the two
        dice.
